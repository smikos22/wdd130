                <h1>Goodies </h1>
                <p>Not everyone has the time to bake for the holidays. Our assortment of goodies is sure to please even the pickiest of eaters. This is a feast worthy of a king and fit for a large crowd of people. There will even be a couple of food trucks in the parking lot to grab a lunch while you are shopping for gifts. Don’t forget all those office Christmas parties you will need to bring items for. You are sure to be the hit of the party by grabbing some of our tasty goodies. Contact Information: 2nd page: Calling all artist and local bakers. If you are interested in getting a vendor booth at our fair please contact Sarah Mikos at 623-993-5615. You can even text your interest to that number if you would like. Please send me the details about what you are selling and what type of space you are looking for. Each spot will cost $50. And 5 percent of your sales after the two days. We don’t accept personal check you will need to pay with a credit card or money order. Spots are limited so please call as soon as possible. Payment options: 2nd page: All vendors have agreed to accept credit cards and cash. Sorry we will not allow personal checks of any kind. There are several banks in the area with ATMs if you need to pull out cash. Talk with all venders and make sure they can take credit cards. Remind them that we aren’t allowing personal checks. There are too many chances of not getting paid with this form of payment.</p>
