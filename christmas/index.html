                    <p> The items showcased at our craft fair will be hand made by residents. 
                        This is a great opportunity to come out and support 
                        our city. Not only would you be showing your support, 
                        but you will be able to get a jump on your holiday 
                        shopping. Everyone has that person that is hard to 
                        shop for. Come get your one-of-a-kind gift for that 
                        special person on your Christmas list.
