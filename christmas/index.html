                <p>All the items showcased at our craft fair will be hand made by residents. This is a great opportunity to come out and support our city. Not only would you be showing your support, but you will be able to get a jump on your holiday shopping. Everyone has that person that is hard to shop for. Come get your one-of-a-kind gift for that special person on your Christmas list. Location: Home Page: Main: We will be gathering at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints on the corner of Litchfield Road and Wigwam Blvd. The address is 301 W Wigwam Blvd, Litchfield Park, AZ 85340. There will be parking at the church and directly across the street is an open lot for back up parking. Make sure to reserve the building and block out Thurs Dec. 1st to get the building ready to host the event. Date and Time: Home Page: Main: Friday Dec. 2nd and Saturday Dec. 3rd. from 9am through 6pm. This is your chance to come out and mingle with neighbors and friends. The first 100 people to come through the door will be entered into a drawing for a 100-dollar shopping voucher you can use with any vendor at the fair.</p>
