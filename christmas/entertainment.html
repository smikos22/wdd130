            <h1>Music </h1>
            <p>Throughout the event there will be different choirs performing. We’ve got several different groups coming to showcase their talent. You don’t want to miss these magical singers to get a complete list of the groups and times please make sure to grab a flyer at the door. You can also see the line up on our website. Need to get times and secure groups for this event. Get in touch with different churches in the area and see if they would like to collaborate. This could be open to school groups and well. A great way to get the community involved and people out to not only watch the singers but shop as well. Need to find a person to handle the sound and get the stage set up.</p>
