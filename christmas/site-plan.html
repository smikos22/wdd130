This is a feast worthy of a king and fit for a large crowd of people.  There will even be a couple of food trucks in the parking lot to grab a lunch while you are shopping for gifts.  Don’t forget all those office Christmas parties you will need to bring items for.  You are sure to be the hit of the party by grabbing some of our tasty goodies.
        Contact Information: 2nd page:  Calling all artist and local bakers.  If you are interested in getting a vendor booth at our fair please contact Sarah Mikos at 623-993-5615.

        Payment options: 2nd page:  All vendors have agreed to accept credit cards and cash.  Sorry we will not allow personal checks of any kind.  There are several banks in the area with ATMs if you need to pull out cash. Talk with all venders and make sure they can take credit cards.  Remind them that we aren’t allowing personal checks.  There are too many chances of not getting paid with this form of payment.

      <h3>Entertainment</h3>
      <p>
        Music: 3rd page:  Throughout the event there will be different choirs performing.  We’ve got several different groups coming to showcase their talent. You don’t want to miss these magical singers to get a complete list of the groups and times please make sure to grab a flyer at the door.  You can also see the line up on our website.  Need to get times and secure groups for this event. Get in touch with different churches in the area and see if they would like to collaborate.  This could be open to school groups and well.  A great way to get the community involved and people out to not only watch the singers but shop as well. Need to find a person to handle the sound and get the stage set up.
